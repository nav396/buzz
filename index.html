Caffeine: Breaking Down the Buzz



Caffeine has a perk-up effect because it blocks a brain chemical, 
adenosine, which causes sleepiness. On its own, moderate amounts of 
caffeine rarely cause harmful long-term health effects, although it is 
definitely possible to take too much caffeine and get sick as a result.



Consuming too much caffeine can make you feel jittery or jumpy—your 
heart may race and your palms may sweat, kind of like a panic attack. It
 may also interfere with your sleep, which is especially important while
 your brain is still developing.
